- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielsanuwich - MSc student at DTU studying Technology Entrepreneurship with a background in Architecture.
- 👀 I’m interested in sustainability and digitisation in the AEC! Why? We spend 90% of our time inside buildings, the industry accounts for 40% of the CO2 emissions and it is STILL a very conservative and slow industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding and business... Ye it is challenging.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious and interested people within AEC trying to make a dent in the universe!
